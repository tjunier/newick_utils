The Newick Utilities are a suite of programs for working with Newick-formatted
phylogenetic trees.

Installing
==========

Binaries
--------

If you have a binaries distribution (that is, with a name like
newick-utils-x.y.z-bin-x86-64.tar.gz), you do not have to compile. The binaries
are in ./src ; they all have names that start with nw_, so you can do 

$ sudo cp src/nw_* /usr/local/bin	# or wherever you want

You can test the programs by cd'ing to ./tests, and doing the following:

$ for test in test*.sh; do ./$test; done


Source
------

If you have a source-only distribution, or if you want to build the binaries,
it's the familiar

$ ./configure
$ make
$ make check	# optional
$ sudo make install

There are no fancy options.  See INSTALL for details. 

You need a C compiler (C99; I use GCC). You also need Flex and Bison, but
chances are they're already installed if you have GCC. Otherwise, it's something like

$ sudo apt-get install flex bison	# Ubuntu and other Debian-based systems
$ sudo yum install flex bison	# Fedora, etc 

MacOS users need to install Xcode. Some spurious error messages may be
reported, and a nw_gen test may fail - AFAICT this is due to differences in the
random number generators between MacOS and Linux.
